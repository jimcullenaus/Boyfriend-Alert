# Boyfriend-Alert
Okay a bit of context is needed for this project. It isn't the most difficult thing (it's actually pretty easy) but if you want to see a writeup of how it works check my [blog](https://jscd.pw/n).

The TLDR is that I made this as a birthday present to my girlfriend so she could get my attention while I'm super focused on video games or programming. I put the URL to my home server as an apple browser home shortcut so she could just tap the icon and activate the light.

To use, `configsecrets.php` should be created and look as follows:

```php
<?php
$key = '<myKey>';
$domain = 'mydomain.com';
```
